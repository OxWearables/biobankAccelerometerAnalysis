A tool to extract meaningful health information from large accelerometer datasets. The software generates time-series and summary metrics useful for answering key questions such as how much time is spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, or doing physical activity.

## Installation
Dependencies include: unix, java 8 ([Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)) and python 3.7 ([Anaconda's Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or installation via [Brew](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) should do the trick).

Note for developers: If you are actively developing the package, you may wish to skip the installation step.

### OS X/Linux
```
$ git clone https://github.com/activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis.git
$ cd biobankAccelerometerAnalysis
$ bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh # Downloads example data and models for behaviour classification
$ pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrades pip version if required
$ pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt # Installs a known working set of dependencies, other package versions may also work
$ javac -cp java/JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java/*.java # Compiles Java code
$ 
$ # Now to install the package, run: 
$ pip3 install --user . 
```

### Windows
Open Anaconda prompt and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis.git
$ cd biobankAccelerometerAnalysis
$ utilities\downloadDataModels.bat # Downloads example data and models for behaviour classification
$ pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrades pip version if required
$ pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt # Installs a known working set of dependencies, other package versions may also work
$ javac -cp java\JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java\*.java # Compiles Java code
$ 
$ # Now to install the package, run: 
$ pip3 install --user . 
```
Note: You may need to open Anaconda prompt as administrator depending on how it was installed. Alternatively, create a virtual environment.

For Windows, you always want to run "utilities\downloadDataModels.bat" and "python" rather than "bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh" or "python3".

## Keeping up to date 
`biobankAccelerometerAnalysis` is regularly updated (e.g. a new dependency was introduced in January 2021, making the models compatible with the newest versions of dependency packages). To install the most recent version with the most recent set of dependencies: 
```
$ git pull
$ cd biobankAccelerometerAnalysis
$ bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh # Downloads example data and models for behaviour classification
$ pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrades pip version if required
$ pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt # Installs a known working set of dependencies, other package versions may also work
$ javac -cp java/JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java/*.java # Compiles Java code
$ 
$ # Now to install the package, run: 
$ pip3 install --user . 
```

## Usage
To extract a summary of movement (average sample vector magnitude) and
(non)wear time from raw Axivity .CWA (or gzipped .cwa.gz) accelerometer files:

```
$ python3 accProcess.py data/sample.cwa.gz
 <output written to data/sample-outputSummary.json>
 <time series output written to data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz>
```

The main JSON output will look like:
```
{
    "file-name": "sample.cwa.gz", 
    "file-startTime": "2014-05-07 13:29:50", 
    "file-endTime": "2014-05-13 09:49:50", 
    "acc-overall-avg(mg)": 32.78149, 
    "wearTime-overall(days)": 5.8, 
    "nonWearTime-overall(days)": 0.04,
    "quality-goodWearTime": 1
}
```

To visualise the time series and activity classification output:
```
$ python3 accPlot.py data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz data/sample-plot.png
 <output plot written to data/sample-plot.png>
```
![Time series plot](docs/source/samplePlot.png)

The underlying modules can also be called in custom python scripts:
```Python
    from accelerometer import summariseEpoch
    summary = {}
    epochData, labels = summariseEpoch.getActivitySummary("sample-epoch.csv.gz", 
            "sample-nonWear.csv.gz", summary)
    # <nonWear file written to "sample-nonWear.csv.gz" and dict "summary" updated
    # with outcomes>
```

## Under the hood
Interpreted levels of physical activity can vary, as many approaches can be 
taken to extract summary physical activity information from raw accelerometer 
data. To minimise error and bias, our tool uses published methods to calibrate, 
resample, and summarise the accelerometer data. [Click here for detailed 
information on the 
data processing methods on our wiki.](https://biobankaccanalysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html)
