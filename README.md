![Accelerometer data processing overview](docs/source/accelerometerLogo.png)

A tool to extract meaningful health information from large accelerometer datasets. The software generates time-series and summary metrics useful for answering key questions such as how much time is spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, or doing physical activity.

![Build status](https://github.com/activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Installation
Dependancies include: unix, java 8 ([Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)) and python 3.7 ([Anaconda's Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or installation via [Brew](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) should do the trick).
```
$ git clone https://github.com/activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis.git
$ bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh
$ pip3 install --user .
$ javac -cp java/JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java/*.java
```

**Note that a major fix/improvement was introduced in April 2020. You therefore need to download the updated files to achieve this**.
::
	$ git pull
        $ bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh
        $ pip3 install --user .
        $ javac -cp java/JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java/*.java



## Usage
To extract a summary of movement (average sample vector magnitude) and
(non)wear time from raw Axivity .CWA (or gzipped .cwa.gz) accelerometer files:

```
$ python3 accProcess.py data/sample.cwa.gz
 <output written to data/sample-outputSummary.json>
 <time series output written to data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz>
```

The main JSON output will look like:
```
{
    "file-name": "sample.cwa.gz", 
    "file-startTime": "2014-05-07 13:29:50", 
    "file-endTime": "2014-05-13 09:49:50", 
    "acc-overall-avg(mg)": 32.78149, 
    "wearTime-overall(days)": 5.8, 
    "nonWearTime-overall(days)": 0.04,
    "quality-goodWearTime": 1
}
```

To visualise the time series and activity classification output:
```
$ python3 accPlot.py data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz data/sample-plot.png
 <output plot written to data/sample-plot.png>
```
![Time series plot](docs/source/samplePlot.png)

The underlying modules can also be called in custom python scripts:
```Python
    from accelerometer import summariseEpoch
    summary = {}
    epochData, labels = summariseEpoch.getActivitySummary("sample-epoch.csv.gz", 
            "sample-nonWear.csv.gz", summary)
    # <nonWear file written to "sample-nonWear.csv.gz" and dict "summary" updated
    # with outcomes>
```

## Under the hood
Interpreted levels of physical activity can vary, as many approaches can be 
taken to extract summary physical activity information from raw accelerometer 
data. To minimise error and bias, our tool uses published methods to calibrate, 
resample, and summarise the accelerometer data. [Click here for detailed 
information on the 
data processing methods on our wiki.](https://biobankaccanalysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html)
